# California Housing Regression Assignment 🏡

## 📘 Objective

The goal of this assignment is to **apply multiple regression algorithms** to the **California Housing dataset** and compare their performance using standard evaluation metrics.

---

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing`

The dataset contains information about various features of houses in California such as:

* Median Income
* House Age
* Average Rooms
* Average Bedrooms
* Population
* Average Occupancy
* Latitude
* Longitude

**Target Variable:** `MedHouseVal` — the median house value in each district.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

The following regression algorithms are trained and compared:

1. **Linear Regression** – Baseline linear model for simple relationships.
2. **Decision Tree Regressor** – Handles nonlinear relationships by splitting data into regions.
3. **Random Forest Regressor** – Ensemble of trees reducing overfitting.
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor** – Boosting technique building trees sequentially to minimize errors.
5. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)** – Uses kernel methods for high-dimensional regression.

Each model is trained, tested, and evaluated using the same train-test split for fairness.

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Steps

1. **Loaded** dataset with `fetch_california_housing()`.
2. **Checked for missing values** (none found).
3. **Scaled features** using `StandardScaler` for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude (e.g., Linear Regression, SVR).
4. **Split** the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using:

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** – Penalizes large errors.
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – Average absolute prediction error.
* **R² Score** – Proportion of variance explained by the model.

Performance metrics are displayed in a comparison table and visualized with bar charts.

## 🥇 Results Summary

| Model             |     MSE ↓     |     MAE ↓     |         R² ↑    |
| :---------------- | -------------:| -------------:| -------------:  |
| Linear Regression |   0.555892    | 	0.533200    |     0.575788    |
| Decision Tree     |   0.495235    | 	0.454679    |     0.622076    |
| SVR               |   0.323697    | 	0.377445    |     0.752980    |
| Gradient Boosting |   0.261498    | 	0.348343    |     0.800445    |
| Random Forest     |   0.255368    | 	0.327543    |     0.805123    |



> **Best Model:** **Random Forest**
Because of its low errors, high R², and strong ability to model nonlinear interactions.

> **Worst Model:** **Linear Regression**
Because the dataset has nonlinear relationships that cannot be captured by straight-line modeling.
